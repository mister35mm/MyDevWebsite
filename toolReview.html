    <h1>Visual Studio Code</h1>
    <p>I have had some experience with Visual Studio Code. It is clumsy bloatware and I prefer Notepad++. It is helpful, to excess and confusing to newcomers. To build a simple website, all you need is windows Notepad, and a web browser. Considering as most people on this course have minimum coding skills and 25% can neither navigate their own PC or tell the time. If we were going to code in Python, Rust, WebAssembly, c#, then I could see the point.

    <h1>Codepen</h1>
    <p>
        For the brief time I had to spend evaluating it, I was very impressed. I think NotePad++ and Codepen would be a great combination. Speed, resource lite, and a shorter learning curve.

        I think Codepen is great training tool as it allows you to blend different languages and see the effect immediately, and, fairly accurately.

    <h1>Trello 2.2</h1>
    <p>
        As far as I can tell, this is tool in search of an application. A waste of time, for several reasons. Do you need to project manage a six page website, written by one person? Hardly. Might be useful for a team of people working together on a sophisticated, multi-discipline project. However, for a bunch of mostly newbie programmers, Trello is, unnecessary, unhelpful, unwarranted distraction. Three weeks goes really fast when you are expected to use tools that neither accelerate learning or make use of the instructors time. If I’d never seen it I’d never miss it.

    <h1>Windows notepad & Notepad++</h1>
    <p>
        Notepad++ is my personal favourite. A tool we COULD have used, but didn’t. This is not just my opinion. 
        
        “Learn HTML Using Notepad or TextEdit Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors. However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac). We believe in that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML. Follow the steps below to create your first web page with Notepad or TextEdit.”  - w3schools.com

        There are more poncy ones, like:- Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim, but they are big,scary and unnecessarily complex.
